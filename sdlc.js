// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design 
// Implementation 
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain 




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is where you determin the expectations, needs and demands required to fulfil your goals."
const design = "This step takes the information you have gathered in the analysis of requirements creates a detailed framework that the project will be built on."
const implementation = "This step is where the project will be implemented based on the design, all needs determined will also be applied, including any hardware or software."
const testingAndIntegration = "This step is where the software will be tested and if succesful, it will go live."
const maintain = "Once the software is completed it will need to be maintained and updated as technology progresses."
